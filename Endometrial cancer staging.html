Study:  MRI Pelvis without and with contrast
Clinical Information/History: [free text]
Comparison: [free text]
Technique:  Prior to and following the uneventful intravenous administration of contrast, T1 and T2 weighted images in multiple planes were obtained through the pelvis. Prior to contrast administration, diffusion-weighted images were obtained through the pelvis. 
Findings:
UTERUS: Measures [ ] x [ ] x [ ] cm [Describe other uterine findings, excluding the tumor.]
TUMOR SITE: [Describe the tumor location: posterior/anterior/fundal/body/lower uterine segment] 
TUMOR SIZE: [Give 3 dimensions (eg: 2 cm x 2 cm x 5 cm), unless the tumor is too small or ill-defined to measure, then dictate: tumor too small or too ill-defined to measure.]
MYOMETRIAL INVASION: [less than 50% myometrial wall thickness invasion/greater than or equal to  50% myometrial wall thickness invasion]
INVASION of the tumor into the cervix stroma: [yes/no/indeterminate]
EXTENSION of tumor into adjacent structures: [None/vagina/parametrium/bowel/bladder]; [presence/absence of ureteral dilatation]
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: [None or add any specific comments related to the tumor here if appropriate] 
OVARIES: The ovaries are [not visualized/visualized] and are [normal/abnormal] in appearance. [Right Ovary measures # x # x #cm and left ovary measures # x # x #cm.] [If abnormal describe.]
LYMPH NODES:
There are [no/few/many] lymph nodes; [The largest pelvic lymph node is located (give location) and measures (give size).] [The largest para-aortic lymph node measures (give size)]. These lymph nodes are [likely/possibly/less likely to be/unlikely to be] malignant.
ADDITIONAL PELVIC FINDINGS: [None; presence/absence pelvic fluid; presence/absence pelvic peritoneal implants; other findings]
BONES:  [No aggressive bone lesions]
Impression:
1.	Endometrial cancer [summarize the endometrial tumor, including extent of invasion and provide your impression of whether there are suspicious lymph nodes].
